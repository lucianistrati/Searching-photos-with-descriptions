# Searching-photos-with-descriptions

The idea of this project is to be able to search a picture out of a folder of thousands of pictures just by typing in a description of what it is that you are actually looking for. 

Say you want to find that picture with your cutie dog when you were at the sea a coupley of years ago, but you don't really remember what was the exact month when you took that picture or you just took thousands of pictures in that month and is still hard to do it.

Also, another cool stuff for searching pictures or any files honestly would be to create and SQL-like user friendly interface where you can search a picture / a file, perhaps you want to do stuff like:
- check files that were created / modified only on one specific day and as well those that contain a description / transcription similar to what you write ( with a possiblity of using a slider of similarity
- being able to see maybe 2 items if you set 95% similarity between your input and the actual description of the text or 10 items if you set 90% similarity between that same input-description text sim)
- selecting two (or more) pictures/files which might be duplicated and being able to perhaps automatically delete them (also with a slider of similarity)
- selecting who created / modified the file
- sorting the files on some other arbitrarly assigned criterias (especially the ones influenced by the transcription of the video
